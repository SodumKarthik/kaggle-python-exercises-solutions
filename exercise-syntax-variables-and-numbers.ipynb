But actually, it will print `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` twice in a row. `evens` and `odds` refer to the same object, so appending an element to one of them appends it to both of them. This is occasionally the source of hair-pulling debugging sessions. :)\n\nAnother consideration is expressions that have side effects. For example, `list.pop` is a method which removes and returns the final element of a list. If we have `L = [1, 2, 3]`, then `a = b = L.pop()`, will result in `a` and `b` both having a value of 3. But running `a = L.pop()`, then `b = L.pop()` will result in `a` having value 3 and `b` having value 2.","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"q7.hint()\nq7.solution()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
